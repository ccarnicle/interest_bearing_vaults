# Direct Aave Pool Integration Plan — DFSEscrowManager (Flow EVM)

This document outlines a practical, hackathon-focused plan to integrate `DFSEscrowManager` with an Aave-style Pool on Flow EVM without requiring ERC-4626 in this phase.

The target flow is:
- users enter and fees are collected in escrow
- after contest entry closes, admin supplies pooled funds to Aave Pool once
- before payout, admin withdraws once
- winnings are distributed in one payout transaction

---

## Needed Information (Provide First)

### Required addresses

- **Flow EVM chain**
  - chain ID (expected mainnet: `747`)
- **Aave Pool proxy address** (for the market you will use)
  - candidate shared: `0xbC92aaC2DBBF42215248B5688eB3D3d2b32F2c8d`
- **Underlying token address** for contest funds
  - for hackathon path: Stargate USDC token address on Flow mainnet
- **aToken address** for that reserve
  - used for visibility/accounting checks

### Strongly recommended metadata

- **PoolAddressesProvider** address for this market
- confirmation that `asset` reserve is active and has available supply capacity
- confirmation there is no supply/withdraw pause on the reserve
- any protocol-specific constraints (caps, fee model, cooldowns if any)

### Access/ops info

- admin/owner wallet that will call invest/withdraw functions
- target contest timeline assumptions (e.g., invest window, expected holding period)
- preferred overflow policy (where yield surplus goes if payouts are less than withdrawn)

---

## Goal

Update `DFSEscrowManager` to support direct `IPool.supply/withdraw` integration for one-shot investment after entry close, while preserving current contest and payout semantics.

---

## Scope (Phase 1: Hackathon-Safe)

- keep existing escrow creation/join/distribution structure
- add explicit invest and unwind steps
- avoid per-join investing to reduce complexity and accounting risk
- enforce pool/asset guardrails
- maintain organizer-driven payout process

Out of scope for this phase:
- ERC-4626 adapter/wrapper standardization
- fully automated keeper scheduling
- multi-market routing/yield optimization

---

## Contract Design Changes

## 1) New interfaces and storage

- add minimal `IPool` interface with:
  - `supply(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode)`
  - `withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) returns (uint256)`
- add per-escrow fields:
  - `address pool` (allowlisted pool for this escrow)
  - `uint256 pendingToInvest` (funds collected but not supplied yet)
  - `bool invested` (whether escrow has executed supply step)
  - optional: `uint256 principalInvested` (for reporting and guard checks)

## 2) Escrow creation path

- keep existing `createEscrow` behavior for contest metadata
- add a new creation function (or extend existing) to set:
  - `_pool` address
  - `_asset` token
- validate:
  - pool is in allowlist
  - token is in allowlist (USDC for hackathon path)

## 3) Join/add-to-pool changes

- on user join and top-up:
  - transfer tokens to `DFSEscrowManager` as today
  - **do not auto-deposit into external yield source**
  - increment `pendingToInvest` by amount received

## 4) Invest step (single-shot)

- add `investEscrowFunds(uint256 escrowId)` (organizer or owner):
  - require `block.timestamp >= escrow.endTime` (or configurable invest window)
  - require `pendingToInvest > 0`
  - approve pool for `pendingToInvest`
  - call `pool.supply(asset, pendingToInvest, address(this), 0)`
  - set `invested = true`
  - move `pendingToInvest` into `principalInvested` (if tracked), then zero pending

## 5) Withdraw step (single-shot)

- add `withdrawEscrowFunds(uint256 escrowId, uint256 minExpectedAssets)` (organizer or owner):
  - require escrow ended
  - require `invested == true`
  - call `pool.withdraw(asset, type(uint256).max, address(this))`
  - require `withdrawn >= minExpectedAssets` (slippage/safety guard)
  - keep funds in manager for distribution

## 6) Distribution step

- keep `distributeWinnings` winner checks and overflow logic
- source payout from manager’s token balance after withdraw
- if winnings are distributed without any invest step, behavior should still be deterministic (current non-yield fallback)

---

## Guardrails and Security

- add owner-controlled allowlists:
  - allowed pools
  - allowed tokens
- add pause mechanism for invest/withdraw functions
- use `SafeERC20.forceApprove` (reset to 0 then set) before `supply`
- apply CEI pattern and preserve `nonReentrant`
- emit events:
  - `EscrowInvested(escrowId, pool, asset, amount)`
  - `EscrowWithdrawn(escrowId, pool, asset, amount)`

---

## Suggested Function Sequence (Operational)

1. organizer creates escrow (pool + asset configured)
2. users join until `endTime`
3. organizer/admin calls `investEscrowFunds(escrowId)`
4. wait holding period (e.g., ~12h)
5. organizer/admin calls `withdrawEscrowFunds(escrowId, minExpectedAssets)`
6. organizer calls `distributeWinnings(escrowId, winners, amounts)`

---

## Testing Plan

- unit tests for:
  - invest requires ended escrow and positive pending amount
  - withdraw requires invested escrow
  - distribute fails if funds unavailable
  - overflow/yield recipient behavior
  - allowlist enforcement
  - paused invest/withdraw path
- integration test on Flow test environment (or fork-like setup):
  - supply/withdraw round-trip with Stargate USDC market
  - verify contest payout after unwind

---

## Rollout Plan

- Phase A: implement and test local/mocks
- Phase B: testnet dry run with known pool/token addresses
- Phase C: mainnet deploy with guarded allowlists
- Phase D: run first low-value contest and monitor all events/transfers

---

## TODO (Post-Hackathon)

- migrate lending integration behind an ERC-4626 wrapper/adapter for standardized vault abstraction
- optional: support per-escrow vault wrappers to improve composability and analytics

**Additional Notes**: The current `DFSEscrowManager` uses Yearn vaults (`IVaultFactory` + `IYearnVault`). For this Flow/MORE integration, we will **replace or bypass** the Yearn path with direct Pool calls. Yearn dependencies should be removed for this version of the contract. We should Keep the code for the original DFSEscrowManager in an old contract "DFSEscrowManager_Yearn.sol" or something similar.
